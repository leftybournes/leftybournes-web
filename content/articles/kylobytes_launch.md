Today is the start of a New Year and I've been thinking of starting a blog the 
whole year last year. Now's the time to take action! I started working on this
blog last November and thought it would be perfect to launch at the start of
2018.

## What's this blog about?

I aim to share my thoughts on technology, specifically on Linux, open source,
free software and programming. I shall also log what I learn throughout my
journey towards becoming a programmer. Plus, I may also write some of my random
thoughts and ideas on anything so stay tuned!

If you're wondering who I am, you can find out more on the [about page](/about/).
You can also find me on
[Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/109252877533134991431). And don't forget to
check out my [personal portfolio](https://www.kentdelante.info/).


## How regular are articles going to be posted?

I plan to post articles on a biweekly basis.


I hope you enjoy reading, and learn at least a bit from, my blog. Here's to a
prosperous 2018.
