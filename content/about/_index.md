# About

Linux, open source and programming are topics I care much about. Kylobytes is my way
of sharing my thoughts and opinions on these technologies. This is also a blog on my
journey towards becoming a hacker.

## Why 'Kylobytes'?

The name 'Kylobytes' comes from my dog's name, Kylo, and the common term 'bytes' in
computer science. It's also a wordplay on kilobytes.
