** About

[[file:/img/about/author.jpg][Photo of author]]

I am a Linux and Open Source enthusiast and a self-taught developer. Kylobytes
is my way of sharing my thoughts and opinions on these subjects. This is also
a platform for me to share showcase [[https://reactjs.org][React]] projects and perhaps
[[https://vuejs.org][Vue]]. React projects can be found [[https://react.kylobytes.tech][here]].

*** Why 'Kylobytes'?

The name "Kylobytes" is a result of wordplay on "kilobytes". "Kylo" is my dog's
name.
